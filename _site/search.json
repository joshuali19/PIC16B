This can be done with any type of grouping (with Island and any other categorical variable).\nWe see that within each sex, there seems to be a clear distinction with Adelie penguins from the other two species with regard to Culmen Length. We also see this similar distinction with Gentoo penguins and the other two with regards to Culmen Depth.\nI would encourage you to form more tables if you would like to find more insights, but for the purposes of this demonstration, this is sufficient information to create a visualization based on Culmen Length and Culmen Depth.\n\n\n2. What is the best type of visualization (for your data)?\nObjectively, the best visualization is a pie chart (just kidding). Each type of visualization serves its own purpose given the type of data you want to visualize. Here are some pointers for which visualization to use for different data.\n\nScatter plots\nScatter plots are most useful with two continuous variables, as it seeks to plot points within a 2-dimensional grid. This will match what we want to visualize with Culmen Length (mm) and Culmen Depth (mm).\n\n\nBar plots, box plots\nBoth bar and box plots are most useful when you are graphing a continuous variable with a categorical variable. One of the axis will denote the categories, while the other will display the length (or spread) corresponding to the continuous variable.\n\n\nTables\nThese are helpful with categorical data, seeing if there is any correlation, or displays the relative frequency of the data.\n\n\nHistograms\nThis is helpful in a univariate and bivariate setting. Both display the data in sets of bins that will display the distribution of data among those points. The data can be discrete or continuous, but the axes will always be coerced to categorical bins.\nThere are a bunch of different plot types, which I will not go more in depth about, but please explore on the official documentation of matplotlib, plotly or any other plotting software that you might use.\n\n\n\n3. Create your visualization\nFor this example, we will use matplotlib to create my visualization. As stated above, we will use a scatter plot to display this information. The necessary parameters for a scatter plot are the x\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'], penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis fulfills the requirement of plotting. However, if someone was given this visualization, it would be completely uninformative. What are the axes measuring? In what unit? What does each point represent? We need to add some informative labels and narrative text that best describes this.\n\n\n4. Label the visualization\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'], penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'])\n\n# add labels\nax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)',\ntitle = \"Relationship between Penguin Culmen Depth and Length\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nNice! We have some points on a grid that represent Culmen Length and Culmen Depth. What does this visualization tell us about the relationship between the two variables? At a first glance, it seems like there is no real indicator of any correlation between the two. Recall the information that we learned about from the summary statistics. There were differences seen when separated by the Species. Let us implement the first through some color contrast, which can be done through adding parameters to the plt.scatter() function.\n\n\n5. Subset the data by groups\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# for each species, map out the culmen length/depth of each penguin\nfor speci in penguins['Species'].unique():\n    ax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci],\n     penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci])\n\n# add labels\nax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)',\ntitle = \"Relationship between Penguin Culmen Depth and Length\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know which color corresponds to each species? We now need to add a legend.\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# for each species, map out the culmen length/depth of each penguin\nfor speci in penguins['Species'].unique():\n    ax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci],\n     penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci],\n     label = speci) # added label to specify each species\n\n# add labels\nax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)',\ntitle = \"Relationship between Penguin Culmen Depth and Length\")\n\n# adds a legend, which automatically is displayed if \"label\" is set in ax.scatter\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. How does this inform people?\nGreat! You have now created your first data visualization! However, a pretty visualization means nothing unless you can draw insight out of it. How does this visualization help further your analysis? How would the readers interpret this graphic?\nIn this example, we have visualized the relationship between Culmen Length and Culmen Depth for penguins by species. The clustering within each group suggests that there may be some boundaries (with error) that could accurately assess the species of a penguin through these two traits. This can lead down the path of creating more visualizations to be exhaustive with your search, or to perhaps create a model."
