    "text": "Extract elements from a web page\nThis is practice to figure out what CSS elements are needed to be extracted. This is done manually so that you get a good sense of how to access specific elements. In this example, we will be looking at the web page corresponding to Community.\nIn general, the framework of extracting elements is as follows: - find the element you want to extract - right-click on the element, and select “Inspect”. - note the HTML tags that uniquely identify that element.\n\nNavigate to “Full Cast & Crew”\nFor this project, we want to view the “Full Cast & Crew” page of the TV page. We will find that in the middle-left of the page, and we can see that the HTML tags wrapped around it are <section class=\"panel top_billed\">, <p> and <a> tags. We can see the URL we want to go to reflects a relative path that adds to the current web page (i.e. /cast).\n\nUnderlying HTML Code: \nWe will now go to this page.\n\n\nNavigate to an Actor’s Page\nSince we want to find the filmography of every actor, we need to navigate to each individual actor’s page. For this example, we will look at navigating to Joel McHale’s (plays Jeff Winger in Community) page.\nThe element we want is McHale’s headshot, which provides a URL to go to his page. We inspect this element, and see that his headshot is within a <ol class=\"people credits\">, <li>, <a> tag. We want the URL found in the <a> tag, in the attribute href.\n\nUnderlying HTML Code: \nWe can now navigate to his page.\n\n\nExtract all the works they have acted in\nNow, we are able to look at McHale’s work in the Acting section. We will look at how to extract his name from the page, as well as “California King” from the filmography.\nFirst, we will extract his name from the big title on the top of the page. We can see that the element is wrapped in a <div class=\"title\">, and <a> tag.\n\nUnderlying HTML Code: \nNow, let us look at “California King”. We can see that it is wrapped in a <table class=\"card credits\">, <a class=\"tooltip\">, and <bdi> tag.\n\nUnderlying HTML Code: \nWith this information, we can now begin to automate this process with scrapy."

    "section": "Create A Spider",
    "text": "Create A Spider\nThis section will look at the creation of a spider. There are a couple of steps that you need to take.\n\nCreate a new repository\nEnsure scrapy is in your environment\nStart a scrapy project in the repository\n\n\nCreate a new repository\nThe first step is to create a new GitHub repository. This is done through a GitHub account. This repository will house your spider, and can be version controlled to account for different changes. Sync it up with your corresponding GitHub Desktop account, and clone the repository to your local device with this tutorial.\nNow that the repository is local, we can move on to the next step.\n\n\nEnsure scrapy is in your environment\nThe easiest way to do this is to open up Anaconda-Navigator, and to look at the tab “Environments”. Find the environment that corresponds to the one you will run the spider on. Search for scrapy on the installed packages. If it doesn’t show up, find it on the uninstalled packages and install it.\n\n\nStart a scrapy project in the repository\nSince you have scrapy installed and a local repository, navigate to the local repository via Terminal, and type the following:\nconda activate <myenv>\nscrapy startproject TMDB_scraper\ncd TMDB_scraper\nThis will automatically create a spider with the necessary python files for it to run. In particular, we will use settings.py. Go into the spiders folder and also create a tmdb_spider.py file and write this as the base.\n\n# to run \n# scrapy crawl tmdb_spider -o movies.csv\n\nimport scrapy\n\nclass TmdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = 'tmdb_spider'\n    \n    start_urls = ['https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/18347-community']"

    "section": "Automate extraction through the spider",
    "text": "Automate extraction through the spider\nWe will now automate extraction through the spider. This is where we will need to recall the information we gained earlier (see above), as well as have knowledge of CSS selectors. Find out more about CSS selectors here and here. As you experiment with how to extract this via code, it is helpful to use scrapy shell instead of using trial and error and running .py files.\n\nScrapy Shell\nHere is a small example of using scrapy shell for experimentation. Navigate to the repository, open up a terminal, and run scrapy shell https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/18347-community(NOTE: You may run into errors such as 403, please look to here for guidance on how to resolve that; you want to see numbers of the form 200).\nHere is what happens when you run scrapy shell https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/18347-community, which is a request to access the main page for Community.\n\nYou can see that there is are two lines of GET (200) ..., which signifies that the request went through. I then sent a request to find the URL for the “Full Cast & Crew” page, by subsetting via the tags it is wrapped in:\nresponse.css(\"section.top_billed p.new_button a\").attrib['href']\nThis can be done to experiment with other subsetting to ensure you are getting the right elements.\n\n\nCreating Functions to Scrape TMDB\nNow, we are able to create a web scraper, complete with functions that will do it for us at one command. There are three main functions necessary for us to scrape the filmography of actors from Community. We need a function to parse to main TV page, one to parse the list of actors, and one to parse the actor’s filmography. All of these functions should go into the tmdb_spider.py file under the TmdbSpider class. I will go through each one.\n\nRepository\nHere is the repository that houses all the data and code for this scraper.\n\n\nParsing main TV page\n\ndef parse(self, response):\n        '''\n        Parses the TMDB cast and crew website.\n        @ input:\n        - self: TmdbSpider\n        - response: the call to start_urls[0]\n        @ output:\n        - yields a request to navigate to the page with actors.\n        '''\n        cast = self.start_urls[0] + '/cast' # hardcode the cast page\n        \n        # go to cast & crew page, run parse_full_credits\n        yield scrapy.Request(cast, callback = self.parse_full_credits)\n\nThis function gets the starting URL, which is linked to the TMDB Community page. Since we recognize that the “Full Cast & Crew” can be found by just adding /cast to the end of the URL, we just hardcode that in, and send a request to go to that URL, and to run parse_full_credits.\n\n\nParsing the acting credits page\n\ndef parse_full_credits(self, response):\n        '''\n        for each actor, goes to their respective acting profile page on TMDB.\n        @ input:\n        - self: TmdbSpider\n        - response: the call to the \"Full Cast & Crew\" page\n        @ output:\n        - yields a request to navigate to the profile page of each actor.\n        '''\n        \n        # for each page redirection on the cast photos\n        for page in response.css('ol.people.credits:not(.crew) li a'):\n            actor_page = page.attrib['href'] # obtain the hyperlink\n            actor_page = 'https://www.themoviedb.org' + actor_page # append to main url\n            \n            # go to the actor's page, run parse_actor_page\n            yield scrapy.Request(actor_page, callback = self.parse_actor_page)\n\nThis function assumes that we are on the page with all the actors in Community. We now need to navigate to every actor’s home page. As mentioned earlier, we know that the link is contained within the HTML tags of <ol class=\"people credits\">, <li>, and <a>. However, that alone is not enough to get ONLY the actors; it includes the crew members. We don’t want that, so looking further into the HTML code, we see that the crew members has a special designation in their tag <ol class=\"people credits crew\">. We can use this to our advantage to omit any <ol> tags with class “crew” with the :not() CSS selector. Now, we get that for every element within the actors section, obtain the hyperlink for their page, and submit a request to go to the actor’s profile for every actor in Community, and run parse_actor_page.\n\n\nParsing actor’s profile page\n\ndef parse_actor_page(self, response):\n        '''\n        obtains the films of the actor.\n        @ input:\n        - self: TmdbSpider\n        - response: the call to the actor's page\n        @ output:\n        - yields a dictionary with actor name and movie.\n        '''\n        # obtain the actor name\n        actor_name = response.css('div.title a::text').get()\n        \n        # for each of the links in the acting section of his or her page\n        for acting_gig in response.css('h3.zero + table.card.credits a.tooltip bdi::text'):\n            title = acting_gig.get() # obtain the right URL\n            \n            yield {'actor': actor_name, 'movie_or_TV_name': title} \n            # yield a dictionary with actor and title of movie they were in.\n\nThis function assumes that you are on the actor’s page. We first need to get the actor’s name for our dictionary, which is conveniently placed in bold font at the top of the page in a <div class=\"title\"> and <a> tag. The harder part is getting the movies/TV shows that the actor has acted in. In this case, it is found underneath <h3 class=\"zero\">. The selectors to the right of the + operator denote that you only want to find elements within h3.zero. You go within the <table class=\"card credits\"> and <a class=\"tooltip\"> and <bdi> tags to get the text within these subsets. That will give you the title. For every film, we can yield a dictionary linking a person with a specific film.\nWith these three functions, we are able to run the spider and have it crawl the TMDB website for Community websites. This can apply to any other start URL for other movies or TV shows."

    "text": "Figure out how to avoid blockers\nThis is something that will be common as you scrape the web more. Websites will have methods that will determine if there is a bot or a program scraping data. If they detect suspicious behavior of this sort, they will block the request to obtain data, which will be displayed in the form of 40_ errors. This is a hinderance to data collection, but there are workarounds for it.\nFor this example with the default settings, TMDB will block requests to access their data, creating a 403 error. My workaround was based off of this article: I changed three lines in my settings.py file.\nBy default, your scrapy user agent will identify itself as a scraper when it goes to scrape websites. However, this is a clear indicator for websites to block the request. I changed the user agent by assigning a common user agent in my settings.py file.\n\n## settings.py\n\nUSER_AGENT = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.79 Safari/537.36 Edge/14.14393'\n\nAnother way that websites can discern a suspicious request is the speed of download requests. An automated bot that knows where to look would be faster than any human interaction with the interface. Therefore, it is important to set a good delay of download to not raise suspicions.\n\n## settings.py\n\n# Configure a delay for requests for the same website (default: 0)\n# See https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#download-delay\n# See also autothrottle settings and docs\nDOWNLOAD_DELAY = 5\n\nThe last thing I did was disable cookies, because some websites use cookies to spot bot behavior.\n\n## settings.py\n\n# Disable cookies (enabled by default)\nCOOKIES_ENABLED = False\n\nHowever, these changes may not work for everyone. I would advise you to check out these other links (link1, link2, link3) for more help."

Coming into this post, I expected that there would be at least some Marvel movie, given that Community is directed by the Russo Brothers, and a majority of the cast has appeared on some of their movies. Instead, we are given many different TV shows. This makes sense given that people have the potential to make guest appearances to most of these shows. Likewise, Community itself is a show with many guest appearances due to their many homages to popular culture and movie tropes. A future direction would be to select only the actors who appear in a “majority” of episodes, and to only include recurring characters (not one episode guest appearances), to see if this list would change. However, we can see from this that the whole cast of Community has a wide array of actors with popular TV shows on their filmography."

We will first start off with 3 Convolution layers and MaxPooling layers, adding a dropout layer in hopes to prevent overfitting, and flatten out the nodes and to classify the input as either a cat or a dog. Read more about the different types of layers for a convolutional neural network (CNN) here. We also need to compile() the model, which will determine what metrics and optimizer we use to evaluate the performance of the model on the training and validation data. Based on literature and recommendations, this model will use the Adam optimizer for stochastic gradient descent, and evaluate the performance through binary cross-entropy and accuracy.\n\nmodel1 = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape = (160, 160, 3)),\n    layers.MaxPooling2D(),\n    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n    layers.MaxPooling2D(),\n    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n    layers.MaxPooling2D(),\n    layers.Dropout(0.05),\n    layers.Flatten(),\n    layers.Dense(32, activation = 'relu'),\n    layers.Dense(1, activation = 'sigmoid')\n])\n\nmodel1.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),\n              metrics = ['accuracy'])\n\nmodel1.summary()\n\n\n\nModel 1 Summary\n\n\nhistory = model1.fit(train_dataset, \n                     epochs=20, \n                     validation_data=validation_dataset)\n\ndef acc_eval(history, title, threshold):\n    '''\n    creates a plot of accuracy over epoches.\n    @ input:\n    - history: the neural network\n    - title (str): Title of Visualization\n    @ output:\n    - plot: plot of accuracy\n    '''\n    plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label = 'training')\n    plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label = 'validation')\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.xticks(np.arange(0, 21, 2))\n    plt.xlabel(\"epoch\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"accuracy\")\n    plt.axhline(y = threshold, color = 'r', linestyle = 'dashed')\n    plt.show()\n\nacc_eval(history, \"Model 1\", 0.52)\n\n\n\nModel 1 Performance\n\n\nAs seen from the output of the model fit and the visualization, we can see that the output stablized between 55% and 60% validation accuracy during training. This is only slightly better than the baseline accuracy of 50%. When evaluating for overfitting, we need to look at the difference between the training accuracy and the validation accuracy. Since the training accuracy has trained to be more than 90% accurate while the validation accuracy stayed below 60%, it is reasonable to say that the model is overfitting to the training data."

    "section": "Templates",
    "text": "Templates\nNow that you have your app.py file, you now need to create templates that would act as what you would want to display on your website for given pages. In your directory, create a folder called templates, and begin to add template files in the form of .html.\nFor starters, here are some tags that will be helpful for you to better understand what is going on in HTML notation:\n\n<title>: sets the title of the webpage, displayed on the browser tab.\n<nav>: section for navigation links\n<h1>: heading\n<ul>: unbulleted list\n<li>: list element\n<a>: link\n<section>: defines section\n<header>: heading of section\n\nIf you would like to learn more, please check out this link.\n\nbase.html\nIn this .html file, this will provide the basic template that the pages will follow, so that you don’t have to repeat the same code over and over again for different web pages of this website. Here is the code for my base.html. I will walk through some of the logic of my code.\n<!doctype html>\n<!-- <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}\"> -->\n<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %} - PIC16B Message Bank</title>\n<nav>\n  <h1 class=\"title\">Message Bank</h1>\n  <!-- <b>Navigation:</b> -->\n  <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"{{ url_for('submit') }}\">Submit A Message</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"{{ url_for('view')}}\">View Random Messages</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</nav>\n<section class=\"content\">\n  <header>\n    {% block header %}{% endblock %}\n  </header>\n  {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n</section>\nFirst, I set my title for the webpage as {% block title %}{% endblock %} - PIC16B Message Bank. This brings us to some interesting notation, which is {% and %}. The purpose of those characters is to make anything within them a part of a template. So if another HTML file wants to overwrite the title in base.html, it can write anything in between {% block title %} and {% endblock %} to replace it. We will see this later.\nThen, we get to the navigation, which contains two links in a list to either Submit A Message or View Random Messages, each linked with the respective page that they should redirect to.\nThen, within the content section, we see again two more templates, one for the header and one for the content. We will see how we will alter this with different pages.\n\n\nsubmit.html\nThe first page that we will need to make is a submit.html, so that users can write a message and submit it to the database. However, we do not need to rewrite the code written in base.html, but expand upon that by writing with the template blocks. Here is the code:\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block title %} Submit a Message {% endblock %}\n\n{% block header %}\n  <h1> Submit a Message </h1>\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n  <form method=\"post\">\n    <label for=\"message\">Your Message:</label>\n      <br>\n    <textarea cols=\"80\" rows=\"10\" id=\"message\" type=\"text\" name=\"message\" required>\n</textarea>\n    <!--<input class = \"msg\" name=\"message\" id=\"message\">-->\n      <br>\n      <br>\n    <label for=\"user\">Your Name or Handle:</label>\n    <input name=\"user\" id=\"user\" required>\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      <div class=\"text-center\">\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit message\">\n      </div>\n  </form>\n\n  {% if name %}\n<p><b>Thanks for submitting a message! Here is your message:</b></p>\n<p class=\"message\">&emsp; \"{{message}}\" </p>\n  {% endif %}\n\n  {% if error %}\n    <br>\n    Please fill out both your message and your handle.\n  {% endif %}\n{% endblock %}\nAt the top, we see this code: {% extends 'base.html'%}. This lets our app know that this will build off of the template made from base.html. As I said earlier, we will only need to change the contents within the blocks, which is what we did. We change the title and header to display Submit a Message. We also change the content block with a <form> that will take in user input and allow them to submit that message.\nWe see that there are two other blocks containing if statements. This will be run only if the condition is held, which we will cover how to control when this happens.\n\n\nview.html\nThe other page we need to create is the page to view other people’s submissions. It will follow the same base.html template, but will display different information than submit.html. Here is the code:\n{% extends 'base.html' %}\n\n{% block header %}\n  <h1>{% block title %}Some Cool Messages{% endblock %}</h1>\n{% endblock %}\n\n{% block content %}\n  {% if msgs %}\n<p>Here are some of the messages people have sent!</p>\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    {% for msg in msgs %}\n        <div> \"{{ msg[1] }}\"\n            <br> &emsp;- {{ msg[0] }}\n    </div>\n    <br>\n    {% endfor %}\n  {% endif %}\n\n  {% if error %}\n    <br>\n    We could not display any messages. This is because there are no messages stored.\n  {% endif %}\n{% endblock %}\nThe logic is similar to that of submit.html, but now in the content block, we see that there is a for loop that will display messages if msgs is available.\nThese are the basic files that are necessary to run the file. Now, we need to work on piecing them all together so that app.py can connect to these pages and display them correctly."

This function will connect with the submission page of the website (see the submit() function).

The function itself will also take this message and handle and add it to the table through a SQL query, using get_message_db() in order to establish our connection.\nThis function also provides the output necessary to write a confirmation message to the user that their message was put into the database. We write the insert_message() to a local variable that contains the message and the handle. These become keyword arguments to render_template() to activate the if name statement within the submit.html so that the page would thank them for a message and spit out their message back to them to show what they have submitted (see submit.html)."

This connects with the view() function, where the number of messages to view is hard coded as 5. Using get_messages_db() to obtain the connection, we use a SQL query to randomly order the rows in the table and getting the top n messages. In the view() function, it is stored within a local variable called msgs, which is a list containing tuples with the message and handle. When render_template() is called with the argument msgs, we use a for loop cycle through the n messages and to display them on different <div> tags (see view.html).\nThese functions are all helpful in the web app, allowing for a database to be utilized to store messages created by users and to retrieve said messages for viewers’ entertainment."

Each of the three tables contain important information and relationships that would be helpful if they were all merged together. We will write a function that takes a SQL query to take these tables, extract the necessary columns from each, and output a dataframe with all the information to create a visualization. I would encourage you to look at each of the tables and their columns to get a sense of what information there is. For the sake of this demonstration, this will be given to you. We want\n\nThe station name\nThe latitude of the station\nThe longitude of the station\nThe country where the station is located in\nThe year the reading was taken\nThe month the reading was taken\nThe average temperature at this station at the given year and month\n\n\nConstruct a SQL Query\nThis function we are able to make will only work if we extract the right information from the SQL query. This subsection will inform you of the SQL syntax, and some common tips.\n\n1. SQL Syntax\nThere are various keywords used in SQL that form a query. Here is a brief overview of the commands necessary for reading a table.\n\nSELECT - extracts columns from table\nFROM - used in conjunction with SELECT to specifies the table you are extracting from\n(FULL|INNER|RIGHT|LEFT) JOIN - joins two tables together (the four keywords denote if a table keeps all their data)\nON - used in conjunction with JOIN keyword to specify the columns that link the two tables together\nWHERE - subsets the table to a given specification\nGROUP BY - similar to pandas.groupby(), groups table by specific columns\nHAVING - used in conjunction with GROUP BY to specify more subsetting within groups.\nORDER BY - rearranges table to order by specific columns\nDESC - used in conjunction with ORDER BY to specify reverse ordering\nLIMIT - limits the number of rows outputted\n\n\n\n2. Common Tips\nThere are a couple queries that are commonly used in SQL. Here are some of them, and I will explain it all in detail\n\nExample 1:\nSELECT * FROM temperatures;\nThe * character denotes a wildcard, meaning all columns. This statement will extract all columns from the temperatures table.\n\n\nExample 2:\nSELECT year, month, temperature FROM temperatures\nWHERE month = 12;\nGet the year, month, and temperature from the temperatures table, subsetted only to the month of December.\n\n\nExample 3:\nSELECT t.id, t.temperature, s.name FROM temperatures t\nINNER JOIN stations s\nON s.id = t.id;\nGet the id and temperature from temperatures and name from stations, aliased as t and s, respectively.\n\n\nExample 4:\nSELECT t.id, t.temperature, s.name FROM temperatures t\nINNER JOIN stations s\nON s.id = t.id\nWHERE t.temperature > 20;\nThe same query as Example 3, but subsetted by temperatures greater than 20.\n\n\nExample 5:\nSELECT t.id, AVG(t.temperature), t.year, s.name FROM temperatures t\nINNER JOIN stations s\nON s.id = t.id\nGROUP BY t.year;\nThe same query as Example 3, but now calculating the average temperature grouped by year.\n\n\n\n3. Constructing the Query\nNow that we have a better understanding of SQL, we will have to construct the query that will serve as the basis for this function. Here are the specs for the query, for your convenience:\n\nThe station name\nThe latitude of the station\nThe longitude of the station\nThe country where the station is located in\nThe year the reading was taken\nThe month the reading was taken\nThe average temperature at this station at the given year and month We can start by writing down the columns in a SQL format. However, these variables are not all found in the same table, so we need to join tables together in order for the initial query to work. Look into the tables in your own time to see that the relation key between the temperatures and stations tables is by their ID, and the relationship between temperatures and countries is by a subset of the ID corresponding with the country’s FIPS 10-4 code’.\n\nSELECT s.Name, s.latitude, s.longitude, c.Name, t.year, t.month, t.temperature\nFROM temperatures t\nLEFT JOIN stations s ON t.id = s.id\nLEFT JOIN countries c ON SUBSTRING(t.id, 1, 2) = c.[FIPS 10-4]\nHowever, one of the things that we want to do is to specify subsetting by country, year and month. We can do this by adding the WHERE clause.\nSELECT s.Name, s.latitude, s.longitude, c.Name, t.year, t.month, t.temperature\nFROM temperatures t\nLEFT JOIN stations s ON t.id = s.id\nLEFT JOIN countries c ON SUBSTRING(t.id, 1, 2) = c.[FIPS 10-4]\nWHERE c.NAME == \"<country name>\"\nAND t.year < <year_end>\nAND t.year > <year_begin>\nAND t.month == <month>\nThis is the framework of the query we will use for the function.\n\n\n\nConstructing the Function\n\nimport sqlite3\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nconn = sqlite3.connect('weather.db')\ndef query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):\n    '''\n    runs a SQL query that obtains temperature data for stations in a certain country for given years and months.\n    @input:\n    - country (str): (Official) Country Name \n    - year_begin (int): starting year to look for\n    - year_end (int): end year to look for\n    - month (int): which month to look at\n    @output:\n    - df: takes SQL results as a dataframe\n    '''\n\n    # SQL query\n    cmd = '''\n    SELECT s.Name, s.latitude, s.longitude, c.Name, t.year, t.month, t.temp\n    FROM temperatures t\n    LEFT JOIN stations s ON t.id = s.id\n    LEFT JOIN countries c ON SUBSTRING(t.id, 1, 2) = c.[FIPS 10-4]\n    WHERE c.NAME == \\\"{0}\\\"\n    AND t.year <= {2} AND t.year >= {1}\n    AND t.month == {3}'''.format(country, year_begin, year_end, month)\n\n    # establish connection\n    \n    return pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn) # return data frame\n\nquery_climate_database(\"India\", 1980, 2020, 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      NAME\n      LATITUDE\n      LONGITUDE\n      Name\n      Year\n      Month\n      Temp\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      PBO_ANANTAPUR\n      14.583\n      77.633\n      India\n      1980\n      1\n      23.48\n    \n    \n      1\n      PBO_ANANTAPUR\n      14.583\n      77.633\n      India\n      1981\n      1\n      24.57\n    \n    \n      2\n      PBO_ANANTAPUR\n      14.583\n      77.633\n      India\n      1982\n      1\n      24.19\n    \n    \n      3\n      PBO_ANANTAPUR\n      14.583\n      77.633\n      India\n      1983\n      1\n      23.51\n    \n    \n      4\n      PBO_ANANTAPUR\n      14.583\n      77.633\n      India\n      1984\n      1\n      24.81\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      3147\n      DARJEELING\n      27.050\n      88.270\n      India\n      1983\n      1\n      5.10\n    \n    \n      3148\n      DARJEELING\n      27.050\n      88.270\n      India\n      1986\n      1\n      6.90\n    \n    \n      3149\n      DARJEELING\n      27.050\n      88.270\n      India\n      1994\n      1\n      8.10\n    \n    \n      3150\n      DARJEELING\n      27.050\n      88.270\n      India\n      1995\n      1\n      5.60\n    \n    \n      3151\n      DARJEELING\n      27.050\n      88.270\n      India\n      1997\n      1\n      5.70\n    \n  \n\n3152 rows × 7 columns"

It also tells us about potential missing data, since not all lines start at the same point. For this particular station Tezpur, we do not see any particular trend for any given month, but that would have to be verified with numbers."

This can be done with any type of grouping (with Island and any other categorical variable).\nWe see that within each sex, there seems to be a clear distinction with Adelie penguins from the other two species with regard to Culmen Length. We also see this similar distinction with Gentoo penguins and the other two with regards to Culmen Depth.\nI would encourage you to form more tables if you would like to find more insights, but for the purposes of this demonstration, this is sufficient information to create a visualization based on Culmen Length and Culmen Depth.\n\n\n2. What is the best type of visualization (for your data)?\nObjectively, the best visualization is a pie chart (just kidding). Each type of visualization serves its own purpose given the type of data you want to visualize. Here are some pointers for which visualization to use for different data.\n\nScatter plots\nScatter plots are most useful with two continuous variables, as it seeks to plot points within a 2-dimensional grid. This will match what we want to visualize with Culmen Length (mm) and Culmen Depth (mm).\n\n\nBar plots, box plots\nBoth bar and box plots are most useful when you are graphing a continuous variable with a categorical variable. One of the axis will denote the categories, while the other will display the length (or spread) corresponding to the continuous variable.\n\n\nTables\nThese are helpful with categorical data, seeing if there is any correlation, or displays the relative frequency of the data.\n\n\nHistograms\nThis is helpful in a univariate and bivariate setting. Both display the data in sets of bins that will display the distribution of data among those points. The data can be discrete or continuous, but the axes will always be coerced to categorical bins.\nThere are a bunch of different plot types, which I will not go more in depth about, but please explore on the official documentation of matplotlib, plotly or any other plotting software that you might use.\n\n\n\n3. Create your visualization\nFor this example, we will use matplotlib to create my visualization. As stated above, we will use a scatter plot to display this information. The necessary parameters for a scatter plot are the data that will into the x and the y axis.\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'], penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'])\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nThis fulfills the requirement of plotting. However, if someone was given this visualization, it would be completely uninformative. What are the axes measuring? In what unit? What does each point represent? We need to add some informative labels and narrative text that best describes this.\n\n\n4. Label the visualization\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'], penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'])\n\n# add labels\nax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)',\ntitle = \"Relationship between Penguin Culmen Depth and Length\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nNice! We have some points on a grid that represent Culmen Length and Culmen Depth. What does this visualization tell us about the relationship between the two variables? At a first glance, it seems like there is no real indicator of any correlation between the two. Recall the information that we learned about from the summary statistics. There were differences seen when separated by the Species. Let us implement the first through some color contrast, which can be done through adding parameters to the plt.scatter() function.\n\n\n5. Subset the data by groups\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# for each species, map out the culmen length/depth of each penguin\nfor speci in penguins['Species'].unique():\n    ax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci],\n     penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci])\n\n# add labels\nax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)',\ntitle = \"Relationship between Penguin Culmen Depth and Length\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know which color corresponds to each species? We now need to add a legend.\n\n# create a scatter plot by culmen length and culmen depth\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\n# for each species, map out the culmen length/depth of each penguin\nfor speci in penguins['Species'].unique():\n    ax.scatter(penguins['Culmen Length (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci],\n     penguins['Culmen Depth (mm)'][penguins['Species'] == speci],\n     label = speci) # added label to specify each species\n\n# add labels\nax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)',\ntitle = \"Relationship between Penguin Culmen Depth and Length\")\n\n# adds a legend, which automatically is displayed if \"label\" is set in ax.scatter\nax.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. What insights can you draw from the visualization?\nGreat! You have now created your first data visualization! However, a pretty visualization means nothing unless you can draw insight out of it. How does this visualization help further your analysis? How would the readers interpret this graphic?\nIn this example, we have visualized the relationship between Culmen Length and Culmen Depth for penguins by species. The clustering within each group suggests that there may be some boundaries (with error) that could accurately assess the species of a penguin through these two traits. This can lead down the path of creating more visualizations to be exhaustive with your search, or to perhaps create a model."
